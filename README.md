# git-collaboration

A learning repo for LCW+.

Inside the `html` directory is the starting file, `andie.html`, which creates a simple webpage with a title, banner, subheads and paragraphs.

It loads css files from the same file name in side the `css` directory, `andie.css`.

Using that basic web page as starter code, create your own simple web page using html and css. Commit the result, and you can even make a pull request.

# Directions:

1. Clone this repo locally.
1. Create a branch with a descriptive name to work in.
1. To start, make a copy of `andie.html` inside the `html` directory. Rename it to say `{your-name}.html`.
1. Do the same and make a copy of `andie.css` with your name as the file name. Be sure to keep it in the `css` directory.
1. To see the web rendering of the html file, either open it in your browser of choice using its file explorer, or use the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code.
1. Update your HTML and CSS to make a web page unique to you. You can keep most of the template example in the `andie` directories. Here are a few suggestions of things you might change:
   1. The accent color (currently purple).
   1. Add some interesting content, like a photo or links.
   1. Change the font-size of the paragraphs.
   1. Play with the current width and margin settings one at a time to see how they impact the web page.
1. Remember to be saving and committing your work frequently.
1. At the end, make a MR.
